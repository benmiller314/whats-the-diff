Taking a break to freewrite, 2020-09-04, Friday, extended deadline day. Today we're going to look at the house on Douglas for the second time, with an open house coming up this weekend; it feels urgent to make an offer on the house, but I'm worried about what we can afford, about getting outbid, about not wanting to spend more than 460 when we intend to offer 450 as a starting point for negotiation (and is there that kind of haggling when you're talking about a house?). Don't know how much to expect to spend on air conditioning, don't know how much it will cost just to get the house inspected. But we're meeting with Sara Minshull today, so she should know the answers to at least the last question and the first, if not the second.

And then there's this writing project. Still can't think directly about it, because first I have to ventilate about the fact that I haven't worked on my book for about two weeks and I'm sort of low-key freaking out about that? Even after I finish this chapter (which I really do have to finish - I've put so much down already), I also have to finish that review for the edited collection. See if I can finish it in just a night or two, reserve morning time for the book. Goal is to reconnect with Jean, figure out who else I can ask to look at the chapters. Is the topic modeling chapter ready to send to Scott? Do I dare? I think I should. He's trustworthy, and knows what it's like to have Big Promise alongside self-doubt and perfectionism and too many things in the works. I really ultimately need to get feedback from Rachael Levay, but that shouldn't be my first stop.

God, the intro chapter. I think maybe I should do a total fresh start, memory draft, then merge the two versions.

And now back to diffs. Picture your students, Ben. Think about who you're trying to convince: not the teachers, not the editors, but the first-years who still think the course is going to teach them what they've been doing wrong, and the way to do things right. Picture yourself as a freshman. Picture quant kids still emerging from their post-high-school chrysalis convinced that they aren't writers.

What are your pictures for? Not the ones from the previous paragraph, I mean the screenshots you've been taking (and boy, I hope they'll be high-enough resolution for print. It's tricky, though...). Is the point to be a bestiary of revision moves? Is the point to be a gallery of difference engines?

Where would each of those galleries belong?

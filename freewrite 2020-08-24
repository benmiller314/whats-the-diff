This is maybe less of a freewrite and more ventilation... I'm just having a lot of trouble "latching on" to this project. Lots running through my head:
- house visit this afternoon
- when am I going to be able to look at our finances to know how much house we can afford?
- there are probably problems in our savings / mutual funds related to the pandemic...
- there's SO MUCH PREP left to do for classes
  -- WWD
    - I want to finish reading the new Sorapure experience
    - which will then help me write up the **prompt for the Dear Data project**
    - will they use postcards? simulated postcards? half a piece of 8.5x11 paper? photograph them?
    - should I have them do any kind of writing related to the Onuoha piece?
    - are there even documents / articles / websites coming in for them to review and categorize?
    - different ways of summarizing the mini dataset of data-uses that we have
  -- CDM
    - I can't even remember what's in lesson 2. Probably something with the GitHub website.
    - Does installing the desktop app also install git if you don't already have it? I don't know!
    - Try to set up groups ahead of time, based on responses to the tech comfort survey
    - Reach out to absent student, see if they're async or What

- and there's also lots to do with getting Nathan and Aaron's paperwork in

- and the reviews for the Digital Methods collection (should I do those first?)

- Should I ask Writing Spaces for an extension? Even if I did, when would I be able to hold it off until?

OKAY. Bathroom break, then when I come back, some actual freewriting on What The Diff.


8 minutes left in the pom. Brilliant.
5 minutes, now. Just spent about 3 minutes reading back over what I have so far.
4 minutes.

The intro as it exists in the long form of my proposal is already 511 words. For the final chapter, I'm targeting around 3000.

I know I need to show some of the images I've started capturing:
- the menu item to name a save in gdocs
- revision history in gdocs, showing diffs in place
- staged changes in GitHub, showing diffs side-by-side, with a commit message prompt
- revision history
- link out to Chamberlain's "Draftback" chapter and gif (in the process throwing a citation toward JITP)
- my comments from the bottom of the doc-so-far includes another 257 words' worth of useable material.

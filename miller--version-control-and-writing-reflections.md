# What’s the Diff? Version Control and Revision Reflections

	“Version control. Always. Everywhere. For everything.”
	 – Karl Stolley, “The Lo-Fi Manifesto 2.0”

You’ve probably been told by your teachers to “reflect on your writing.” (And if you haven’t, chances are good it’ll happen quite soon.) But what does that mean? In my experience, without specific questions to answer, a lot of students will tell me how they feel about that particular piece of writing: whether they’re happy with it or worried about it, or just happy to be done worrying about it. While that’s useful information, to be sure, if the goal is to learn from your experience to help in future writing projects, I’m more interested in what strategies or textual moves you use to revise – and in expanding the revision strategies you have experience with.

I’m taking the phrase “revision strategies” from one of the classic studies of writing process, by Nancy Sommers. By comparing early and late drafts, she found that beginning student writers tended to make changes at the level of word, phrase, and sentence, and that most of the word/phrase changes were substitutions: they didn’t change the overall structure or meaning. Experienced adult writers, on the other hand, tended to make more changes at larger-than-paragraph levels, like theme or section, and they did a lot more cutting and reordering. It’s an experiment everyone can try: comparing your own early and late drafts, are you operating at sentence-level and below, or do you work bigger-picture? Do you reorder and subtract, substitute or add? And do your answers change as you study writing and get more focused practice and feedback?

But it’s not always easy, in the thick of the writing or after pushing through the thicket, to remember what turns you took, or why; sometimes the new versions just replace what you’d done before, whether figuratively in your memory or literally on your hard drive. In this essay, I want to make the case for using version control technology to help track and make visible what’s changing in the course of a writing project, so you can then assess how “what changes” has changed in the course of a writing class.

A version control system (VCS) is software that can store and display the whole history of a project, including the differences (the “diffs”) between points in that history. As a bonus, a VCS It’s a mainstay of computer programming, especially in the context of collaborative projects shared on GitHub, but it’s also the tool driving a history tab on Wikipedia, and it’s just as helpful for a solo project. The best VCSes prompt (or even require) you to write a short summary of what’s new with each new snapshot you save. When I use a GUI like GitHub Desktop, it visually shows me the changes as I’m writing the message, which in turn prompts me to reflect on what’s actually changed, what’s added, what’s taken away… or if I’m just refining in place. (Not that there’s anything wrong with that. Sometimes.)







When we teach writing classes, we’re not teaching “how to write,” as if there were a one-and-done, never-have-a-problem-again True Way To Write. Instead, as Shelley Reid has argued, we’re teaching ways to solve writing problems, because problems in writing will never really go away. When I ask students for a reflection, I’m asking what strategies they’ve used (especially if they’re new) to solve the problems their writing has thrown up.



But it’s not always easy, in the thick of the writing or after pushing through the thicket, to remember what turns you took, or why; sometimes the new versions just replace what you’d done before. One reason we writing teachers like to ask for drafts is so we can read and respond and ask questions that will help you find a new way forward; but another is also just to save that moment in time, so you can look back on it and see what’s changed.

In this essay, I argue that technology’s made it easier to track those changes – but only if we’re mindful of saving them as we go, and probably even more often than those once-a-week (or less often) draft submissions. Building on Karl Stolley’s advice to “Version control. Always. Everywhere. For everything,”















Let’s face it: writing reflections can be hard. It’s easy to get caught up in the blahblahblah / blowbyblow of what happened.








You’ve probably been told by your teachers to “reflect on your writing.” (And if you haven’t, chances are good it’ll happen quite soon.) But what does that mean? In my experience, without specific questions to answer, a lot of students will tell me how they feel about that particular piece of writing: whether they’re happy with it or worried about it, or just happy to be done worrying about it because, good or bad, now it’s at least done. (Until, of course, they get more responses, suggesting more revision possibilities.) The same thing happens at the end of the semester, when I ask for a reflection on what they’ve learned: if that’s all I ask (and sometimes even when I do give additional directions), what many students turn in is the story of individual  projects, accounts of what they made, sometimes with the implication or hope that the series of stories builds toward triumph.

Yet what I and many writing teachers are hoping will happen when students write these reflections is something else:



Brainstorming. The main thrust of the chapter is that you can use diffs (version history) to see what you do when you revise – and how this might have changed over the course of a writing class. Example: Sommers (1980, and see if that’s been updated in the last 40 years!!) found that beginning student writers tended to make changes at the level of word, phrase, and sentence, and that most of the word/phrase changes were substitutions that didn’t change the overall structure or meaning. Expert writers, on the other hand, tended to make more changes at larger-than-paragraph levels, like theme or section, and they did a lot more cutting and reordering. So it’s an experiment everyone can do: are your changes changing as you study writing and get more focused practice and feedback?

Working with version control – whether it’s full-on git, or a wiki, or google docs – can help make those changes more visible. I especially like writing with git because it forces me to add commit messages, saying what I’ve changed; when I use a GUI like GitHub Desktop, it lets me see the changes as I’m writing the message, which in turn prompts me to reflect on what’s actually changed, what’s added, what’s taken away… or if I’m just refining in place (which also has its place in revision, and please don’t take me to say that substitution is baby stuff: word choice can have a big effect, as William FitzGerald has argued).

that usually ends up meaning that you just say what happened. And there’s some real value in that. But one of the reasons it’s valuable is that documenting what happened lets you see what’s changing.


NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW THIS DOESN’T DUPLICATE Draftback to the Future: A Tool for Writing Process Analysis /
* Different audience (students vs. instructors)
* Doesn’t require the Draftback plugin: we can use “native” gdoc tools, like the named revision, to enable comparisons at key “commit” points


You’ve probably been told by your teachers to “reflect on your writing.” (And if you haven’t, chances are good it’ll happen quite soon.) But what does that mean?



I’m interested in how a piece of writing got to be where it is: what the turning points were, what decisions you had to make (and maybe some paths you chose not to take), when something clicked or took on a surprising life of its own. And I’m interested in how that process repeats, or doesn’t, across projects – how your expectations for what will happen as you work through a piece of writing may change, or not, over the course of a writing class.

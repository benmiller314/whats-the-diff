# What’s the Diff? Version Control and Revision Reflections

*“Version control. Always. Everywhere. For everything.”*
	 *– Karl Stolley, “The Lo-Fi Manifesto 2.0”*


Do you ever wonder what you're supposed to learn in a writing class? And please don't just say "to write": if there's one thing we've found in the last sixty years or so of research on writing, it's that writing situations are incredibly varied; there is no one thing called "how to write" that anyone can pick up in 15 weeks, or a year. E. Shelley Reid, a stand-out teacher of writing teachers, has made the case that we're really working on *how to deal with writing problems*: how to identify them, some strategies to try for the ones we know, and the confidence to keep trying even if the problem hasn't gone away. Because the truth is, even expert, professional writers face writing problems. (And solving some problems often introduces new ones.) Some people just have more practice in surmounting them.

I'm not going to recap Reid's whole argument (though I do highly recommend her Writing Spaces essay on "Ten Metaphors for Writing"). Suffice it to say, one skillset you should build over the course of a writing class – not the only one, but an important one – is a widening set of *revision strategies*: different ways to step into a draft and take it to the next level. In this essay, I want to argue that using version control technology is a great way to find out what revision strategies you're already using – and which ones you have yet to try.

What is version control, you ask? A version control system (VCS) is software that can store and display the whole history of a project, including the differences (the “diffs”) between points in that history. It’s a mainstay of computer programming, especially in the context of collaborative projects like those shared on GitHub, but it’s also the tool driving a history tab on Wikipedia, and it’s just as helpful for a solo project. The best VCSes prompt (or even require) you to write a short summary of what’s new with each new snapshot you save. My preferred tool, GitHub Desktop, visually shows me the changes as I’m writing the message, which in turn prompts me to reflect on what’s actually changed, what’s added, what’s taken away... or if I’m just refining in place. (Not that there’s anything wrong with that. Sometimes.)

I’m taking the phrase “revision strategies” from one of the classic studies of writing processes, by Nancy Sommers. By comparing early and late drafts, she found that beginning student writers tended to make changes at the level of word, phrase, and sentence, and that most of the word/phrase changes were substitutions: they didn’t change the overall structure or meaning. Experienced adult writers made those changes, too, but also tended to go beyond – they made more changes at larger-than-paragraph levels, like theme or section, and they did a lot more cutting and reordering.












You’ve probably been told by your teachers to “reflect on your writing.” (And if you haven’t, chances are good it’ll happen quite soon.) But what does that mean? In my experience, without specific questions to answer, a lot of students will tell me how they feel about that particular piece of writing: whether they’re happy with it or worried about it, or just happy to be done worrying about it. While that’s useful information, to be sure, if the goal is to learn from your experience to help in future writing projects, I’m more interested in what strategies or textual moves you use to revise – and in expanding the revision strategies you have experience with.

There's more to it than the mechanics: the differences here point to different understandings of what we're doing when we go back to something we've written and write more. I used to think my teachers assigned drafts as a way of exerting control; I thought they wanted me to trudge along at the same pace as everyone else, something I always found incredibly difficult and tiring. I never felt like I had done enough thinking by the time I turned stuff in – or, often, I didn't turn anything in, because I felt like I was supposed to have a finished thesis by the time the draft was through. If you're imagining a draft as essentially a finished version of your ideas, then it makes sense that revision would look like tightening up the phrasing here or polishing the flourishes there. (Or, if you're not finished, that any new additions belong at the end of the piece.)

But what I've come to realize – in part, thanks to Nancy Sommers and other comp/rhet researchers – is that there's another way to think about revision and drafts. Someone who goes in



If all the addition happens at the end of the draft, then chances are we're continuing an unfinished line of thought, but not necessarily using that new thinking to re-evaluate the thoughts that got us there.



Someone who goes in and adds a whole paragraph in the middle, though, is probably realizing something needed to be

 the reasons someone might want to insert a whole paragraph in the middle, or take the final sentence of a section and make it the first, are different than the reasons

It’s an experiment everyone can try: comparing your own early and late drafts, are you operating at sentence-level and below, or do you work bigger-picture? Do you reorder and subtract, substitute or add? And do your answers change as you study writing and get more focused practice and feedback?

But it’s not always easy, in the thick of the writing or after pushing through the thicket, to remember what turns you took, or why; sometimes the new versions just replace what you’d done before, whether figuratively in your memory or literally on your hard drive. In this essay, I want to make the case for using version control technology to help track and make visible what’s changing in the course of a writing project, so you can then assess how “what changes” has changed in the course of a writing class.








When we teach writing classes, we’re not teaching “how to write,” as if there were a one-and-done, never-have-a-problem-again True Way To Write. Instead, as Shelley Reid has argued, we’re teaching ways to solve writing problems, because problems in writing will never really go away. When I ask students for a reflection, I’m asking what strategies they’ve used (especially if they’re new) to solve the problems their writing has thrown up.



But it’s not always easy, in the thick of the writing or after pushing through the thicket, to remember what turns you took, or why; sometimes the new versions just replace what you’d done before. One reason we writing teachers like to ask for drafts is so we can read and respond and ask questions that will help you find a new way forward; but another is also just to save that moment in time, so you can look back on it and see what’s changed.

In this essay, I argue that technology’s made it easier to track those changes – but only if we’re mindful of saving them as we go, and probably even more often than those once-a-week (or less often) draft submissions. Building on Karl Stolley’s advice to “Version control. Always. Everywhere. For everything,”















Let’s face it: writing reflections can be hard. It’s easy to get caught up in the blahblahblah / blowbyblow of what happened.








You’ve probably been told by your teachers to “reflect on your writing.” (And if you haven’t, chances are good it’ll happen quite soon.) But what does that mean? In my experience, without specific questions to answer, a lot of students will tell me how they feel about that particular piece of writing: whether they’re happy with it or worried about it, or just happy to be done worrying about it because, good or bad, now it’s at least done. (Until, of course, they get more responses, suggesting more revision possibilities.) The same thing happens at the end of the semester, when I ask for a reflection on what they’ve learned: if that’s all I ask (and sometimes even when I do give additional directions), what many students turn in is the story of individual  projects, accounts of what they made, sometimes with the implication or hope that the series of stories builds toward triumph.

Yet what I and many writing teachers are hoping will happen when students write these reflections is something else:



Brainstorming. The main thrust of the chapter is that you can use diffs (version history) to see what you do when you revise – and how this might have changed over the course of a writing class. Example: Sommers (1980, and see if that’s been updated in the last 40 years!!) found that beginning student writers tended to make changes at the level of word, phrase, and sentence, and that most of the word/phrase changes were substitutions that didn’t change the overall structure or meaning. Expert writers, on the other hand, tended to make more changes at larger-than-paragraph levels, like theme or section, and they did a lot more cutting and reordering. So it’s an experiment everyone can do: are your changes changing as you study writing and get more focused practice and feedback?

Working with version control – whether it’s full-on git, or a wiki, or google docs – can help make those changes more visible. I especially like writing with git because it forces me to add commit messages, saying what I’ve changed; when I use a GUI like GitHub Desktop, it lets me see the changes as I’m writing the message, which in turn prompts me to reflect on what’s actually changed, what’s added, what’s taken away… or if I’m just refining in place (which also has its place in revision, and please don’t take me to say that substitution is baby stuff: word choice can have a big effect, as William FitzGerald has argued).

that usually ends up meaning that you just say what happened. And there’s some real value in that. But one of the reasons it’s valuable is that documenting what happened lets you see what’s changing.


NEED TO THINK ABOUT HOW THIS DOESN’T DUPLICATE Draftback to the Future: A Tool for Writing Process Analysis by Elizabeth Chamberlain (a Kairos editor, writing in JITP). /
* Different audience (students vs. instructors)
* Doesn’t require the Draftback plugin: we can use “native” gdoc tools, like the named revision, to enable comparisons at key “commit” points

Okay, so I just (Fri 2020-08-21, 11am) reread Chamberlain's piece, and there are two things I notice. First, she also starts with the problem of vague reflections: I was possibly remembering that subconsciously when I wrote my draft. So maybe I should actively try to start in a different vein. Second, she doesn't cite Sommers, so that angle (the specific ways your writing processes are *changing*) is new in my piece. Instead, her focus is just on becoming aware of the processes at all, especially the recursiveness and interconnectedness of generating ideas, generating text, and revising both. She was interested in having students line up their expectations of what they did when they wrote with what they actually did. Third (okay, so there's another thing I noticed), the fact that Draftback includes **all** of the revisions recorded by google docs means that there's no hierarchy: major chunks of text appear and disappear in the blink of an eye during playback, while places where the typing got tricky and the writer had to go back and forth within a single sentence a few times show up as several edits (additions and subtractions), and thus play out for longer on the screen. Because it doesn't play back in real time (else we'd be watching it for days or weeks!), Draftback doesn't seem to *pause.*

By contrast, a commit + diffs approach ~~forces~~ asks us to think metacognitively midway through the journey of the writing process – to pause at the end of a chunk of writing or editing and say, "where am I now? where am I going?" (Note the link to Sondra Perl & felt sense, or is that too much? Maybe worth reminding teachers to talk to their students about, I dunno. I'm clearly biased on the Sondra front.)  

There are other advantages to having every change recorded, of course, the biggest of which is that you *don't* have to think about it. Until you get in the habit of writing a commit message every time you save (or stop working), it can be easy to forget about commits, and then all you have to compare is the first draft and the last, and you lose everything in between that didn't make the cut (but might still be useful in the future, for a different audience or a different purpose).

You’ve probably been told by your teachers to “reflect on your writing.” (And if you haven’t, chances are good it’ll happen quite soon.) But what does that mean?



I’m interested in how a piece of writing got to be where it is: what the turning points were, what decisions you had to make (and maybe some paths you chose not to take), when something clicked or took on a surprising life of its own. And I’m interested in how that process repeats, or doesn’t, across projects – how your expectations for what will happen as you work through a piece of writing may change, or not, over the course of a writing class.
